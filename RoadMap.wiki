TortoiseHg 2.0 is scheduled to be release on March 1, or on the same day as Mercurial 1.8.

Following the 2.0 release, a number of improvements are planned for 2.1 (July 1, 2011)

* Merge wizard refactor to not use a QStackedWidget
* Refactor bisect, compress, rebase and backout as QWizard dialogs
* Refactor wctxactions, actions should be owned by StatusWidget and use cmdui.Runner
* Use status widget's file tree in MQ widget
* Merge HgFileView and AnnotateWidget into a single class and file
* Switch ManifestWidget to use an HgFileView
* Add a file filter to manifest widget, same as status
* Remove standalone annotate dialog, use manifest dialog for that purpose
* Move 'other parent' feature from filelistmodel to HgFileView
* filelistview should forward menu events to parent repowidget or chunks widget
* Use Qt's filesystem monitor to inform user when status view is dirty
* Also use Qt's filesystem monitor to replace poll functions in thgrepo, etc
* Investigate whether HgFileView can be used as an editor for wctx in status widget
* Investigate a per-repository tab log console
* Subrepository support in Repository Registry
