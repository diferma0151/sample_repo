= Changes since 3.2.1 =

Since 3.1, Mercurial commands are run in separate
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer|command server]] process.
It generally contributes to reliability, but if you have a faulty extension
or an in-process Python hook, it can corrupt the communication channel between
TortoiseHg and the command server.

If you see an error message like "cmdserver: timeout while reading...",
[[BugReport|please report it]] with the list of enabled third-party extensions
and their versions.  Currently, reviewboard (#3841) and onsub (#3924) extensions
are known to have this issue.

== Bug Fixes ==

* chunks: preserve line ending of source file in diff view (fixes #3975)
* console: do not confuse output with prompt input while idle (fixes #3982)
* filectxactions: directly use boolean evaluation to check for empty
  (fixes #3967)
* init: getExistingDirectory without keyword argument (CentOs 6.3)
* rejects: decode chunk lines as selected content encoding (fixes #3974)
* rename, settings: work around memory corruption by QCompleter(parent)
* repowidget: evaluate dagrange set eagerly to fix crash on "Bundle DAG Range"

== Improvements ==

* mergetools: add 3-way dir diff to BeyondCompare 4 (closes #3976)
