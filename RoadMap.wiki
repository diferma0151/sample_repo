TortoiseHg follows [[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/TimeBasedReleasePlan|Mercurial's]] release schedule for major feature releases.
We try to do stable releases at least once a month to push bug fixes out
to users in a timely fashion.

=== Release Numbering ===

Roughly every four months (thrice a year), we will take the development
branch (default), merge it to the stable branch, and release it as a new
feature release.  In between these feature releases, there will be
multiple maintenance releases since most of our users install our binary
packages and cannot easily get bug fixes any other way.

The first incremental release after a feature release may contain
behavioral or layout changes as we provide polish to the new features
added in that feature release.  The following incremental releases
should be pure bug-fix releases.

=== Lockdown ===

Before each feature release, we will progressively lock down the code:

* -2 weeks  - feature freeze, merge default to stable, bug fixes only
* -1 week   - no new translatable strings on stable
* -3 days   - code freeze on stable.  Documentation and installer changes only

=== Release 2.0 (Targeted March 1, 2011): ===

* PyQt based tools and dialogs
* Native 64bit applications
