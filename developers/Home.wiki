== TortoiseHg Developer Wiki ==

The developer wiki is where new TortoiseHG contributors learn the ropes and
where all contributors can keep track of ongoing work.  For more user-centric
information, please visit the [[Home|main]] wiki.  Bug reports and feature
requests should go in the repository's issue tracker.
