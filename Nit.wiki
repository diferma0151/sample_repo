Feel free to add new categories as necessary.

This is where you register features that are unimplemented or badly implemented in the new Qt dialogs

== Workbench ==

* No commit/qrefresh button for embedded commit tool

== Commit ==

*  qrefresh support
*  auto-select a file at startup?
*  re-select the previous file after refresh
*  threaded / wrapped commit (need a CmdRunner equivalent)
*  qtlib decode failure dialog (ask for retry locale, suggest HGENCODING)
*  Need a unicode-to-UTF8 function
*  +1 / -1 head indication (not as important with workbench integration)
*  recent committers history
*  pushafterci, autoincludes list
*  use date option
*  qnew/shelve-patch creation dialog (in another file)
*  reflow / auto-wrap / message format checks / paste filenames
*  spell check / tab completion
*  in-memory patching / committing chunk selected files

== Quickop ==

* Error messages are not being displayed (cmdui.Widget.pmon.set_text() does not appear to work)

== Settings ==

== qtlib ==

== i18n ==

* Need an encode fail dialog that prompts for an encoding, sets HGENCODING, then retries
* Need functions to convert between unicode<->UTF-8
