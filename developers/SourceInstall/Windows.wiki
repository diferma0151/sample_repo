== Hacking TortoiseHg Qt on Windows ==

To be able to evaluate, test, or hack on the TortoiseHg Qt port, you need to install:

* Python 2.6.X
* py2win32
* iniparse >= 0.3.1
* PyQt >=  4.6 (includes Qsci)
* TortoiseHg >= 1.1 binary installer (for shell extension)

Then you:
* Clone the Mercurial default repo from http://selenic.com/repo/hg
* Get the 6 *.pyd files from the mercurial folder from the library.zip file from your TortoiseHg installation, and copy them into the mercurial folder in the cloned default Hg repo.
* Clone the TortoiseHg thg (qt port) repo from http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg

Add the following thg.cmd script into the root folder of your TortoiseHg Qt clone :
{{{
@echo off
rem
rem thg.cmd
rem
setlocal
set HGPATH=<path\to>\hg-default
set cmdpath=<path\to>\thg-qt
echo --- running thg from %cmdpath%
python "%cmdpath%\thg" %*
rem set THGDEBUG=1
rem python "%cmdpath%\thg" --nofork %
endlocal
}}}

Make sure your python.exe is in de execution path, and from the root folder of  the cloned TortoiseHg qt clone, with
{{{
thg <command>
}}}
you can start evaluating/testing/hacking.

To work with a test repo other than the thg-qt repo itself, just make sure the /path/to/thg-qt is in the path, so your thg.cmd script is found.
