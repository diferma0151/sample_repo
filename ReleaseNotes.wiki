= Release Notes for TortoiseHg =

This wiki page contains last minute notes to users about the releases,
which may not be included in the documentation or README files included
with the distribution kits.  It also contains change information, for
users who are interested in what bugs have been fixed, and what features
have been added in the current version.

**Note that like TortoiseSVN, [[http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2010-January/029680.html|we recommend]] to turn off the indexing service on the working copies and repositories, and exclude them from virus scans.**

== Matching Versions ==

If you are using TortoiseHG from source, we recommend you use the most
recent stable releases of TortoiseHG and Mercurial together.  If you must use
an older version of Mercurial, please consult the following chart:

|= Mercurial Release |= TortoiseHg Release |
| 2.0.x | 2.2.n |
| 2.1.x | 2.3.n |
| 2.2.x | 2.4.n |
| 2.3.x | 2.5.n |
| 2.4.x | 2.6.n |
| 2.5.x | 2.7.n |
| 2.6.x | 2.8.n |
| 2.7.x | 2.9.n |
| 2.8.x | 2.10.n |
| 2.9.x | 2.11.n |
| 3.0.x | 3.0.n |
| 3.1.x | 3.1.n |

= TortoiseHg 3.1 =

TortoiseHg 3.1 is a major feature release.

Since 3.1, Mercurial commands are run in separate
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer|command server]] process.
It generally contributes to reliability, but if you have a faulty extension
or an in-process Python hook, it can corrupt the communication channel between
TortoiseHg and the command server.

If you see an error message like "cmdserver: timeout while reading...",
[[BugReport|please report it]] with the list of enabled third-party extensions
and their versions.  Currently, reviewboard (#3841) and hg-git (#3862) are
known to have this issue.

Note the Windows installers include Mercurial version 3.1 plus two stable commits
which addressed Windows platform-specific bugs.

= TortoiseHg 3.0.2 =

TortoiseHg 3.0.2 is a regularly scheduled bug-fix release.

If you had installed 3.0 and were using the newly bundled hg-svn or hg-git, you must change the name of those extensions to hgsubversion and hggit respectively.  The method of their bundling has been changed because of issue #3768.  Post-upgrade, you should be able to de-select "hg-git" and/or "hg-svn" from the settings dialog and select the new "hggit" and/or "hgsubversion" respectively.

Also note that now that TortoiseHg and Mercurial have synchronized revision numbers, the names of the TortoiseHg installers for Windows have been simplified to include just a single version number.  These installer packages still include TortoiseHg and Mercurial (it would be quite impossible to package one without the other).

== Bug Fixes ==

* cmdthread: map empty promptchoice response to default value \\
  (fixes #3785 - crash on email preview with diffstat)
* grep: fix list of urls to include all dragged files
* grep, status: fix several unicode errors in drag-and-drop handler
* status: fix handling of non-ascii file name in drag-and-drop handler

  (fixes #3786 - ignored files can be deleted even if checkbox is off)
* settings: remove outdated details of default authorcolor behavior
  (fixes #3789)
* thgrepo: preserve config values that are internally set \\
  (fixes #588 - random failure of unified diff with eol extension)

== Improvements ==

* commit: allow amending non-head if obsolete is enabled
* repomodel: do not truncate description if longsummary is enabled (fixes #3776)
* reduce workbench toolbar icon size on Mac to match size on Windows

== Installer ==

* update python keyring library to 3.8
* update dulwich to 0.9.7
* update hg-git to current tip (ab8562b11c4f)

Also note that now that TortoiseHg and Mercurial have synchronized revision numbers, the names of the TortoiseHg installers for Windows have been simplified to include just a single version number.  These installer packages still include TortoiseHg and Mercurial (it would be quite impossible to package one without the other).

== Bug Fixes ==

* commit: do not crash by invalid issue.regex expression (fixes #3732)
* customtools: separate arguments before running external commands (fixes #3752) \\
  the specified command will be executed through the system shell, so
  use {{{start}}} to open new command window (see #3783 for details.)

* repowidget: resize columns only when model is initially loaded (fixes #3742)
* wctxactions: resurrect 'forget' action for added files (closes #3748)
