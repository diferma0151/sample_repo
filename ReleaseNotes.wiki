= Release Notes for TortoiseHg =

This wiki page contains last minute notes to users about the releases,
which may not be included in the documentation or README files included
with the distribution kits.  It also contains change information, for
users who are interested in what bugs have been fixed, and what features
have been added in the current version.

**Note that like TortoiseSVN, [[http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2010-January/029680.html|we recommend]] to turn off the indexing service on the working copies and repositories, and exclude them from virus scans.**

<<toc 1>>

== Matching Versions ==

If you are using TortoiseHG from source, we recommend you use the most
recent stable releases of TortoiseHG and Mercurial together. TortoiseHg synchronized
version numbers with Mercurial at release 3.0, so you should always use the same major
revision number of TortoiseHg as Mercurial for any Mercurial version later than 3.0.
For older versions of Mercurial, consult the table in [[OlderReleaseNotes]]
