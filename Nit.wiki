Feel free to add new categories as necessary.

This is where you register features that are unimplemented or badly implemented in the new Qt dialogs

== Workbench ==

* The changeset graph window starts too small (and does not remember your settings)
* Window cannot be closed with ctrl+q
* Navigation cannot be done with up arrow/down arrow as normal, but has to happen with ctrl accelerator
* Moving from working changeset to the parent shows an empty diff at the parent, if you select another non-working changeset revision you get a diff and navigating back to the working changeset parent shows its diff correctly now
* Underlines of revision and node for parent/child in changeset does not follow the same baseline
* There is no reason for commit message to be italicized.
* F5 should also refresh
* The repository browser takes up a lot of (possibly unnecessary) space, please support hiding it
* It was preferable to have the graph to the far left as that makes more sense visually
* Optional columns are missing (e.g. the node can be useful)
* Current column selection should be saved as a setting.
* Inline searching searches only for matches from the beginning of the line, not for whether a commit contains said text
* Hitting ctrl+g after having done an inline search one is presented with a new control to enter search criteria - at the very least this should be filled out with what you actually searched for - better, it should jump to the next match
* Make changelog column size adjustable, and save them with other settings (might also apply to other parts).
* The graph of the gtk version is much easier to "read" and follow, specially in the more complex parts. The graphical appearance is clearer.

== Commit ==

*  qrefresh support
*  use date option
*  reflow / auto-wrap / message format checks / paste filenames
*  threaded / wrapped commit (need a CmdRunner equivalent)
*  +1 / -1 head indication (not as important with workbench integration)
*  recent committers history
*  pushafterci, autoincludes list
*  qnew/shelve-patch creation dialog (in another file)
*  spell check / tab completion
*  in-memory patching / committing chunk selected files

== Quickop ==

* Error messages are not being displayed (cmdui.Widget.pmon.set_text() does not appear to work)

== Update ==

* "smart update" feature (incomplete)

== Settings ==

* port extensions page
* new [auth] page
* new generic extension registration
* font settings
* new [color] page

== Email ==

* bundle support
* selectively send changesets
* threaded preview
* save history and window size
* handle errors gracefully
* rename module 'hgemail' to 'email' ?

== Grep ==

* I (= Johan) don't like the use of the little treeview-borrowed '+'-button for expanding the query possibilities. It's too small. It's used in other places too; same remark. (It's not because MS uses it in Explorer, we have to take it over elsewhere.) Or there should be a keyboard alternative.  (please, pick an accelerator (ctrl-space?) -- steve) Is there a list of what combination are already in use, or will be used for more important things ? How about ctrl-e (for **e**xpand) ?

== qtlib ==

* pre-defined colors (like gtklib) (most colors will be user-configurable - steve)
* more general means for showing or previewing the generated hg command (see archive dialog)

== i18n ==

* Need an encode fail dialog that prompts for an encoding, sets HGENCODING, then retries
* Need functions to convert between unicode<->UTF-8

== run ==

* slower startup than hgtk

== other ==

* I would like to have a really good way to change fonts in the TortoiseHg qt dialogs. Mostly for enlarging fonts, but in small steps, so each can find their own "best setting". All fonts means both for dialog fonts and for content widgets. This is necessary f.i. for people not having the good sight of a youngster anymore (like me). (Also because changing screen resolution and/or OS settings cannot solve everything.)
