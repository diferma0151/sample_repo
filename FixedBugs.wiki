Note: the Python bindings for subversion were deliberately removed from the
TortoiseHg packages in release 3.4 for security and packaging reasons.
They must be downloaded and setup manually if you need TortoiseHg to interact
with subversion repositories.  See [[libsvn]]

Python 2.4 and 2.5 are no longer supported.

We plan to drop support for PyQt < 4.7.5 in TortoiseHg 4.1 to accelerate the
move towards PyQt 5.
