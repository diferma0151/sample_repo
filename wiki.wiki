== Wiki Details

This is a community supported web page. Please fix any errors and typos
you find and add any content you feel is missing.

This wiki uses the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|Creole]] syntax, and is fully
compatible with the 1.0 specification.

The wiki itself is actually a hg repository, which means you can clone it, edit
it locally/offline, add images or any other file type.

Go ahead and try:

{{{
$ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/wiki/
}}}

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .wiki extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

To test your changes, you can try this Creole [[http://nyctergatis.com/creole/sandbox.creole|sandbox]]

When your changes are complete, commit them locally and then publish those changes to the 
[[mailto:tortoisehg-develop@lists.sourceforge.net |tortoisehg-develop@lists.sourceforge.net]] 
[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tortoisehg-develop|mailing list]].   There are several 
methods for doing this:

=== Using SMTP (preferred for simple changes when possible)
* start the synchronize dialog, or run hgtk push
* click email
* launch configuration dialog to configure SMTP settings
* fill in To: and From: fields
* Send

=== Using patches
* start changelog dialog, or run hgtk log
* select your change, right-click for context menu
* select 'export patch'
* attach this patch to an email to the developer list

=== Bitbucket method (good for bulk changes, or when adding binaries)
* Open an account at http://bitbucket.org (if you don't have one)
* Create a new repository called thg-wiki or similar
* Push your local wiki repository to this bitbucket repo\\
{{{ hg push https://bitbucket.org/myuser/thg-wiki }}}
* Post the URL to your repository to the developer list.
