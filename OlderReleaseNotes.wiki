TortoiseHg 3.2 is a regularly scheduled feature release

Since 3.1, Mercurial commands are run in separate
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer|command server]] process.
It generally contributes to reliability, but if you have a faulty extension
or an in-process Python hook, it can corrupt the communication channel between
TortoiseHg and the command server.

If you see an error message like "cmdserver: timeout while reading...",
[[BugReport|please report it]] with the list of enabled third-party extensions

= TortoiseHg 3.1.2 =

TortoiseHg 3.1.2 is a regularly scheduled bug-fix release.

Since 3.1, Mercurial commands are run in separate
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer|command server]] process.
It generally contributes to reliability, but if you have a faulty extension
or an in-process Python hook, it can corrupt the communication channel between
TortoiseHg and the command server.

= TortoiseHg 3.0.2 =

TortoiseHg 3.0.2 is a regularly scheduled bug-fix release.

If you had installed 3.0 and were using the newly bundled hg-svn or hg-git, you must change the name of those extensions to hgsubversion and hggit respectively.  The method of their bundling has been changed because of issue #3768.  Post-upgrade, you should be able to de-select "hg-git" and/or "hg-svn" from the settings dialog and select the new "hggit" and/or "hgsubversion" respectively.

Also note that now that TortoiseHg and Mercurial have synchronized revision numbers, the names of the TortoiseHg installers for Windows have been simplified to include just a single version number.  These installer packages still include TortoiseHg and Mercurial (it would be quite impossible to package one without the other).

== Bug Fixes ==

== Installer ==

* update python keyring library to 3.8

== Bug Fixes ==

* commit: do not crash by invalid issue.regex expression (fixes #3732)

Released August 20, 2012

This is a scheduled minor release of TortoiseHG (2.4.3), but a major release of Mercurial (2.3)

== Packaged Versions ==

* Mercurial 2.3

Mercurial 2.3 breaks hgsubversion, so you must pull and update your
hgsubversion clone before upgrading to this release.  If you get an error
message "unable to open module repo!", then you have this problem and you must
update hgsubversion.  The same is true for hg-git, it must be updated before
you upgrade to Mercurial 2.3.

If you fail to update your extensions before upgrading, you must disable the
extensions in your Mercurial.ini file, then pull and update them, then finally
re-enable them.

== Installer ==

* x64 installers now provide 64bit native PyQt applications, which means they no longer install in Program Files (x86), they install in Program Files.

If you are upgrading a 1.1 install or have run KDiff3 in the past, it is suggested to run the new KDiff3 and check this configurable.

= TortoiseHg 2.0 =

Released March 1, 2011

This is a major feature release.  All of the TortoiseHg applications
have been converted from PyGtk to PyQt.

* http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/manual/2.0/whatsnew.html
* http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/screenshots.html

== Packaged Versions ==

* Mercurial 1.8
* Qt 4.7.1
* PyQt 4.8.2
* dulwich 0.7.0

== Installer ==

* x64 installers now provide 64bit native PyQt applications, which means they no longer install in Program Files (x86), they install in Program Files.
* hg.exe and thg.exe are not in %PATH%, we add a bin\ folder with short batch files.  TortoisePlink and Pageant.exe are also in the bin\ folder so they remain in the path.
* kdiff3.exe is not in the system path, since it uses the same QT dlls as TortoiseHg it needs to be in the root folder.
* kdiff3.exe was upgraded from the 1.1 release to the 2.0 release.  It appears to have a bug when reading its old configuration files that cause it to save merge results in DOS EOLN.  If you are upgrading a 1.1 install or have run KDiff3 in the past, it is suggested to run the new KDiff3 and check this configurable.
