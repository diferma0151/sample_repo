== Hacking TortoiseHg on Windows ==

To be able to evaluate, test, or hack on TortoiseHg on Windows, you need to install:

* TortoiseHg binary installer (for shell extension and bootstrap) [[https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/downloads|download]]
* Python 2.6.6 [[http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/|download python-2.6.6.msi]]
* Mercurial 1.8 or later Python source package [[https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg-winbuild/downloads/|download mercurial-1.8.win32-py2.6.exe]]
* pywin32 [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/|download pywin32-216.win32-py2.6.exe]]
* PyQt >= 4.8.6, includes Qt and QSci [[http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download|download PyQt-Py2.6-x86-gpl-4.8.6-1.exe]]
* Clone the TortoiseHg source repo: {{{ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg thg }}}

Once all of that is in place, you should be able to cd into the clone and start the Workbench with:

{{{
python thg
}}}

To see the list of commands available, use **python thg --help**

== 64bit ==

If it is your preference, you can download and install the 64bit Python, Mercurial, PyQt, pywin32, etc and run TortoiseHg as a 64 bit application.  In fact, you can have both 32bit and 64bit packages installed at the same time.  Except for the TortoiseHg binary installer, you must install the x64 package on an x64 O/S because of the shell extension.

== Extras ==

* iniparse >= 0.3.1 (optional, allows you to edit configuration files)
* pygments (optional, allows the commit tool to offer variable completions)
