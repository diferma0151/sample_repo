= Changes since 3.1.1 =

Since 3.1, Mercurial commands are run in separate
[[http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer|command server]] process.
It generally contributes to reliability, but if you have a faulty extension
or an in-process Python hook, it can corrupt the communication channel between
TortoiseHg and the command server.

If you see an error message like "cmdserver: timeout while reading...",
[[BugReport|please report it]] with the list of enabled third-party extensions
and their versions.  Currently, reviewboard (#3841) and onsub (#3924) extensions
are known to have this issue.
