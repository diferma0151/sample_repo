TortoiseHg 2.0 adds variable expansion to tortoisehg.editor to allow you to open source files to particular lines.  The is particularly useful when search the repository history.

In general, the syntax is:
{{{
[tortoisehg]
editor = myeditor -flags [$FILE --num=$LINENUM] -moreflags
}}}

If no line number is being passed to the editor, the braces and everything between are removed.
$FILE is optional, if it is not specified the filename is appended.

More specific examples:

Here are 3 examples of editors tested on Windows 7 Professional.

For Scite (the Scintilla example editor) (tested with v2.11) (free, open source) :
{{{
[tortoisehg]
editor = <path\to\>Scite_2.11.exe ["-open:$FILE" -goto:$LINENUM]
}}}
The quotes are mandatory, as I experienced. Scite is also available on Linux.

For NotePad++ (tested with v5.6.8) (free, open source, gpl) :
{{{
[tortoisehg]
editor = <path\to\>Notepad++.exe [$FILE -n$LINENUM] -multiInst
}}}
I experienced the '-multiInst' option as case-sensitive.

For TextPad (tested with v5.3.1) (shareware) :
{{{
[tortoisehg]
editor = <path\to\>TextPad.exe [$FILE($LINENUM)]
}}}
