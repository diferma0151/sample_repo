= User Interface Text Guideline =

== In short ==

* use "Title Caps" for window titles, menu items, push buttons, etc.
* use "Sentence caps" for radio buttons, checkboxes, or dialog messages.
* assign "&" access keys to almost all menu items.
* append ellipsis "..." to menu items only when additional information is
  required to perform the action. For example,
** "Update..." will open dialog to select which revision to update.
** "Diff to Parent" will open diff window immediately.
