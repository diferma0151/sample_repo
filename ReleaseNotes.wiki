== Packaged Versions ==

* Mercurial 1.8

== Installer ==

* x64 installers now provide 64bit native PyQt applications, which means they no longer install in Program Files (x86), they install in Program Files.
* hg.exe and thg.exe are not in %PATH%, we add a bin\ folder with short batch files.  TortoisePlink and Pageant.exe are also in the bin\ folder so they remain in the path.
* kdiff3.exe is not in the system path, since it uses the same QT dlls as TortoiseHg it needs to be in the root folder.
