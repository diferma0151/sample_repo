== Grand Plans ==

TortoiseHg 2.0, scheduled for November 1, 2010, is slated to have PyQt replacements for all PyGtk dialogs

=== Main Application ===

As part of this rewrite, we would like to perform a few cleanups in the design.  The changelog browser, grep and annotate (datamine) tools, and the commit tool should be combined into a single "main application" with a tabbed interface.  This app should be usable from a desktop icon or start menu link, offering a repository list if the cwd is not within a repository.

=== "Sync" Widget ===

A "task" tab of the workbench should replace the "paths" page of the settings tool and the sync bar of the repository explorer.  It should show all configured paths for the repository, allow this list to be modified, and support sync operations with each remote target.. including preview incoming w/ bundle (perhaps creating a new changelog tab), annotating outgoing changes, etc.  We could also put a console pane and progress bar on this tab to show running operations.  Some operations could be banned for certain URLs (p4, svn, git, etc).

=== Simplify Commit, Drop Shelve ===

I prefer to not port the shelve tool.  Instead, the commit tool should allow change hunks to be moved into patches (or just reverted).  In fact, qnew should simply be the act of moving changes into a patch, then pushing it.  The commit tool should always show working diffs, even if there are patches applied.  Moving hunks between patches or the working directory should be tasks for a patches widget.
