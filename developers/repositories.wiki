== TortoiseHg Development Repositories ==

=== Main ===

The main repository hosted on bitbucket that only Steve Borho and a few contributors can push
to. This is the official repository that everyone should clone:

http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/

It has two named branches:

* *stable* contains only released code and reasonably well tested bug fixes. All official release binary installers are built from this repository.

* *default*  This is where development occurs between releases, and is the basis for nightly builds.

A mirror of the main repo is kept at: https://hg01.codeplex.com/tortoisehg/

=== Installer ===

The installer repository, based on a subrepo tree of source repositories and an intelligent setup script.  This repository is used to build TortoiseHg and Mercurial packages for Windows.
