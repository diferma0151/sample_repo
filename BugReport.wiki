== Reporting Bugs and Feature Enhancements ==

First of all, if you have arrived at this wiki page from the link on our bug report dialog, **thank you** for spending the time to report this bug to us.

The first step should be to consult the list of **[[FixedBugs]]** that are already fixed on the tip of the stable branch, and are likely already in the [[http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg-winbuild/downloads|nightly builds]]. Also consult the [[http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issues/?kind=bug&status=open|open bug list]].

If your bug is truly new, or if you have an idea for an enhancement, report it to our issue
[[https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/issues/new|tracker]].  Since 2.0.1, the bug report
dialog has a **Copy** button that copies the bug text to the clipboard.  Simply paste the
report into the entry form.

Frequently, information about the context of what was happening when the bug report was issued is much more important than the stack trace itself.  So if you remember what you were doing when the bug occurred, please add this to the bug report.

Please leave new issues assigned to the 'tortoisehg' user.  This ensures emails for the issue are distributed to the appropriate mailing list.

See our **[[developers/Home|developers]]** wiki for details on contributing patches or other work.
