Feel free to add new categories as necessary.

This is where you register features that are unimplemented or badly implemented in the new Qt dialogs

== Workbench ==

* No commit/qrefresh button for embedded commit tool
* The changeset graph window starts too small (and does not remember your settings)
* Window cannot be closed with ctrl+q
* Navigation cannot be done with up arrow/down arrow as normal, but has to happen with ctrl accelerator
* Moving from working changeset to the parent shows an empty diff at the parent, if you select another non-working changeset revision you get a diff and navigating back to the working changeset parent shows its diff correctly now
* Underlines of revision and node for parent/child in changeset does not follow the same baseline
* There is no reason for commit message to be italicized.
* F5 should also refresh
* The repository browser takes up a lot of (possibly unnecessary) space, please support hiding it
* It was preferable to have the graph to the far left as that makes more sense visually
* Optional columns are missing (e.g. the node can be useful)
* Inline searching searches only for matches from the beginning of the line, not for whether a commit contains said text
* Hitting ctrl+g after having done an inline search one is presented with a new control to enter search criteria - at the very least this should be filled out with what you actually searched for - better, it should jump to the next match

== Commit ==

*  qrefresh support
*  auto-select a file at startup?
*  re-select the previous file after refresh
*  threaded / wrapped commit (need a CmdRunner equivalent)
*  +1 / -1 head indication (not as important with workbench integration)
*  recent committers history
*  pushafterci, autoincludes list
*  use date option
*  qnew/shelve-patch creation dialog (in another file)
*  reflow / auto-wrap / message format checks / paste filenames
*  spell check / tab completion
*  in-memory patching / committing chunk selected files

== Quickop ==

* Error messages are not being displayed (cmdui.Widget.pmon.set_text() does not appear to work)

== Update ==

* "smart update" feature (incomplete)

== Settings ==

* port extensions page
* new [auth] page
* new generic extension registration
* font settings

== Email ==

* bundle support
* selectively send changesets
* threaded preview
* save history and window size
* rename module 'hgemail' to 'email' ?

== qtlib ==

* pre-defined colors (liek gtklib)
* more general means for showing or previewing the generated hg command (see archive dialog)

== i18n ==

* Need an encode fail dialog that prompts for an encoding, sets HGENCODING, then retries
* Need functions to convert between unicode<->UTF-8

== run ==

* slower startup than hgtk
