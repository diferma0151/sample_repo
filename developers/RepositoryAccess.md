# Repository Access and Command Execution

**This feature is UNDER DEVELOPMENT.**

[TOC]

## Overview

* `RepoManager` manages life-cycle of `RepoAgent` and its filesystem monitor.
* `RepoAgent` owns `repository` object instead of extending it to thgrepository.
* `RepoAgent` (and `CmdAgent`) will receive all command requests and run them in sequence.
* Provides consistent *unicode APIs*

## Command Execution

`RepoAgent` and its backend, `CmdAgent`, provide the same APIs to execute Mercurial commands asynchronously.

`runCommand(cmdline)` or `runCommandSequence([cmdline, ...])` start or queue the specified command and return new `CmdSession` object which will provide notification signals.

Example:

~~~~{.py}
    def runUpdate(self):
        sess = self._repoagent.runCommand(hglib.buildcmdargs('update', rev='.'))
        sess.commandFinished.connect(self._onUpdateFinished)

    @pyqtSlot(int)
    def _onUpdateFinished(self, ret):
        if ret != 0:
            # update failed
...
~~~~

The relation between `CmdAgent` and `CmdSession` is similar to the one between `QNetworkAccessManager` and `QNetworkReply`.

### Executors

**CmdThread** (default)

* lightweight and feature-rich
* cannot abort on I/O stall, #1507
* has several thread issues like #1661 or #2071

**CmdProc**

* high overhead (especially on Windows)
* cannot abort *safely* (`kill -KILL` or `TerminateProcess` is used)
* no interactive prompt
* no progress and `ui.label`

**Command Server Client** (planned)

* *not implemented*

## Change History

In 2.9:

* introduce `RepoManager` and stub for `RepoAgent`
* redesign command API of `tortoisehg.hgqt.run`

### TODOs

short-term:

1. have RepoWidget use new classes (mostly done)
1. implement stubs for new classes (mostly done)
1. pass stubs to all widgets (mostly done)
1. implement queued command runner by using cmdui.Core (WIP)
1. implement per-repository command queue (WIP)
1. have cmdui (optionally) accept RepoAgent as command runner (WIP)
1. have RepoWidget use new command runner (WIP)
1. have all widgets run commands via RepoAgent (WIP)
1. move shortname and displayname (WIP)

long-term:

* keep dirstate/wctx up-to-date by RepoAgent?
* better control of `refreshWctx()`
* provide read/write config API
* bundlerepo and `--hidden` flag
* reload root ui object when global setting is changed?
* how to call workbench from sub dialogs?
* drop `thgrepository` extension
* use command server via `QProcess`
* ...

## Issues to Consider

file-system monitoring:

* #812, #1305, #1426, #1469, #1571, #1758, #2565 - RevlogError on strip, rebase, collapse, etc.
* #1594, #2604 - error after qpop
* #1783 - thg keeps a ref to a folderrepo for too long ?
* #2470 - hg push in command line (to SVN with hgsubversion)

repo/ui object:

* #588 - Unified diff view doesn't work well with EOL extension
  â†’ [discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.tortoisehg.user/3341/focus=3345)
* #2208 - Support --config argument for 'thg workbench'

thread/process:

* #1507 - Stop button for pull that hangs
* #1661 - "abort: Interrupted system" call during push with subrepos
* #2071 - crash when pushing with mercurial_keyring
* #2614 - `util.hgexecutable()` returns wrong path
* 074fd0fde0b6 - worker.py of Mercurial 2.6 only works in main thread

unicode:

* #3246 - better handling of UnicodeEncodeError of command-line parameters
