# Repository Access and Command Execution

[TOC]

## Overview

* `RepoManager` manages life-cycle of `RepoAgent` and its filesystem monitor.
* `RepoAgent` owns `repository` object instead of extending it to thgrepository.
* `RepoAgent` (and `CmdAgent`) will receive all command requests and run them
  in sequence.
* Provides consistent *unicode APIs*

## Command Execution

`RepoAgent` and its backend, `CmdAgent`, provide the same APIs to execute
Mercurial commands asynchronously.

`runCommand(cmdline)` or `runCommandSequence([cmdline, ...])` start or queue
the specified command and return new `CmdSession` object which will provide
notification signals.

Example:

~~~~{.py}
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
        self._cmdsession = cmdcore.nullCmdSession()

    def runUpdate(self):
        if not self._cmdsession.isFinished():
            return  # command still running
        cmdline = hglib.buildcmdargs('update', rev='.')
        self._cmdsession = sess = self._repoagent.runCommand(cmdline, self)
        sess.commandFinished.connect(self._onUpdateFinished)

    @pyqtSlot(int)
    def _onUpdateFinished(self, ret):
        if ret != 0:
            cmdui.errorMessageBox(self._cmdsession, self)
...
~~~~

The relation between `CmdAgent` and `CmdSession` is similar to the one
between `QNetworkAccessManager` and `QNetworkReply`.

### Capturing Output

By default, all command outputs are propagated through `outputReceived` signal.
This is very inefficient for transferring large chunks.

There are two alternative APIs:

* `sess.setCaptureOutput(True)` enables in-memory output buffer.  All data
  outputs (excluding ui messages) are buffered by `CmdSession` and can later
  be read by `QIODevice`-like interface.
* `sess.setOutputDevice(device)` redirects all data outputs to the specified
  `QIODevice`.  It can be used to write outputs to `QFile`.

### Executors

**CmdThread** (default < 3.1, removed at 3.2)

* lightweight and feature-rich
* cannot abort on I/O stall, #1507
* has several thread issues like #1661 or #2071

**CmdProc**

* high overhead (especially on Windows)
* no interactive prompt

**CmdServer** (default >= 3.1)

* need to manage server process

### GUI

* `CmdControlDialog` for one-shot command with configurable parameters  
  (e.g. "archive", "clone", "update")
* `CmdSessionDialog` for log window of started command  
  (e.g. "verify", hidden log window of "quickop")
* `CmdSessionControlWidget` to implement dialog which needs unusual handling  
  (e.g. "compress", "import", "rebase")
* bare `LogWidget` and `ThgStatusBar` for others  
  (e.g. "commit", "sync")

* TODO: add utility for tag-like dialogs?

  (in order to replace use of temporary files)
* wrap `ui.edit()` for histedit or rebase --edit?

      (see also 1ff0182d8523, a8c83e9e3b87 and 9d66488a0e67)
    * pool unbound `CmdAgent` and create as necessary
    * per-widget thin proxy to select free `CmdAgent`

  `QIODevice` interface)
* command server over ssh link
* show command to be executed in log widget instead of separate "Hg command"
  text box
* ...
