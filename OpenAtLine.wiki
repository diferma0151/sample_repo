TortoiseHg 2.0 adds variable expansion to tortoisehg.editor to allow you to open source files to particular lines.  The is particularly useful when search the repository history.

In general, the syntax is:
{{{
[tortoisehg]
editor = myeditor -flags [$FILE --num=$LINENUM] -moreflags
}}}

If no line number is being passed to the editor, the braces and everything between are removed.
$FILE is optional, if it is not specified the filename is appended.
