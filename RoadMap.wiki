TortoiseHg follows [[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/TimeBasedReleasePlan|Mercurial's]] release schedule for major feature releases.
We try to do stable releases at least once a month to push bug fixes out
to users in a timely fashion.

=== Release Numbering ===

Roughly every four months (thrice a year), we will take the development
branch (default), merge it to the stable branch, and release it as a new
feature release.  In between these feature releases, there will be
multiple maintenance releases since most of our users install our binary
packages and cannot easily get bug fixes any other way.

The first incremental release after a feature release may contain
behavioral or layout changes as we provide polish to the new features
added in that feature release.  The following incremental releases
should be pure bug-fix releases.

=== Lockdown ===

Before each feature release, we will progressively lock down the code:

* -2 weeks  - feature freeze, merge default to stable, bug fixes only
* -1 week   - no new translatable strings on stable
* -3 days   - code freeze on stable.  Documentation and installer changes only

=== Release 2.3 (Targeted March 1, 2012): ===

* Support filesets in status/commit filter
* Refactor wctxactions to use cmdui.Runner
* Merge dialog needs a cancel button, when appropriate
* Add a file filter to manifest widget, same as status
* Investigate whether HgFileView can be used as an editor for wctx
* Investigate a per-repository tab log console
