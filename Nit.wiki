Feel free to add new categories as necessary.

This is where you register features that are unimplemented or badly implemented in the new Qt dialogs

== Workbench ==

* No commit/qrefresh button for embedded commit tool

== Commit ==

*  qrefresh support
*  auto-select a file at startup?
*  re-select the previous file after refresh
*  threaded / wrapped commit (need a CmdRunner equivalent)
*  qtlib decode failure dialog (ask for retry locale, suggest HGENCODING)
*  Need a unicode-to-UTF8 function
*  +1 / -1 head indication (not as important with workbench integration)
*  recent committers history
*  pushafterci, autoincludes list
*  use date option
*  qnew/shelve-patch creation dialog (in another file)
*  reflow / auto-wrap / message format checks / paste filenames
*  spell check / tab completion
*  in-memory patching / committing chunk selected files

== Quickop ==

* Error messages are not being displayed (cmdui.Widget.pmon.set_text() does not appear to work)

== Settings ==

* port extensions page
* new [auth] page
* new generic extension registration

== qtlib ==

== i18n ==

* Need an encode fail dialog that prompts for an encoding, sets HGENCODING, then retries
* Need functions to convert between unicode<->UTF-8

== Log ==

* The changeset graph window starts too small (and does not remember your settings)
* Window cannot be closed with ctrl+q
* Navigation cannot be done with up arrow/down arrow as normal, but has to happen with ctrl accelerator
* Moving from working changeset to the parent shows an empty diff at the parent, if you select another non-working changeset revision you get a diff and navigating back to the working changeset parent shows its diff correctly now
* Underlines of revision and node for parent/child in changeset does not follow the same baseline
* There is no reason for commit message to be italicized.
* F5 should also refresh
* The repository browser is a waste of space if you do not use subrepos (hide it if no subrepos are present)
* It was preferable to have the graph to the far left as that makes more sense visually
* Optional columns are missing (e.g. the node can be useful)
