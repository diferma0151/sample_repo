== Installing on Ubuntu ==

{{{
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tortoisehg-ppa/releases
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tortoisehg
thg
}}}

Or see [[thg]] for how to run from source.

Note: the TortoiseHg nautilus extension is very old and no longer works with newer Linux releases.  The command line thg tool works just fine.
