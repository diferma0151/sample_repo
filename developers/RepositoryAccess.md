* RepoAgent owns repository object instead of extending it to thgrepository.
* RepoAgent will receive all command requests and run them in sequence.
  It may use cmdserver process to address thread issues [1].
* While running commands, RepoAgent disables RepoWatcher. This will resolve
  temporary LookupError while rebasing, qrefresh, etc.

## Issues to Consider

file-system monitoring:

* #1469 - integrity check failed (probably) on strip or rebase
* #2470 - hg push in command line (to SVN with hgsubversion)

repo object:

* #588 - Unified diff view doesn't work well with EOL extension
  â†’ [discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.tortoisehg.user/3341/focus=3345)

threading:

* #2071 - crash when pushing with mercurial_keyring
* #1661 - "abort: Interrupted system" call during push with subrepos
* 074fd0fde0b6 - worker.py of Mercurial 2.6 only works in main thread
